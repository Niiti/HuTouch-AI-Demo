#  HuTouch 🚀 Unleash your full potential

While corporates/industries profit from AI, we developers are left with Grammarly for coding and irrelevant code. It still is hard to make time for things that matter most or apply our hard earned skills. HuTouch is a personal AI for developers to generate tailored code and unleash their potential at work.

## 🌟 How does HuTouch Help

- Focus on applying your talents on complex/custom/challenging coding tasks while HuTouch generates the 1st working app/screen tailored to your project specs (saves >25% effort & generates >50% reusable code)
- Self review your code with HuTouch to reduce 20% review comments and thus have more time to focus on strengthening the code or validating the architecture
- Elevate your coding skills on the job with the help of articles/short tutorials recommended by HuTouch personalized to your current coding skills

We have over 2 decades of IT experience and understand how difficult it is for us to make time to do things that matter most and so we have dedicated our time to fix this gap with a personal AI - HuTouch (short for human touch).
