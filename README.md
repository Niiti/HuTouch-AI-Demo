## HuTouch: Create Value Not Prompts 

## Problem: 
- Nearly half of Figma to Flutter (#F2F) production ready tasks are repetitive in nature
- AI code is unreliable
- Vibe coding is an additional workflow to existing workload
- No connections to Figma, Postman, IDE and Functional requirements doc to extract project specs

## Solution: 
- Automate boilerplate & prototyping without prompts/vibe coding
- Automatically generate strong Flutter AI code with state management, strong architecture and coding standards
- Integrate with Figma, Postman, IDE and Functional requirements documents to extract project specs

We at Niiti, built HuTouch to help Flutter developers convert Figma to Production ready code **without vibe coding**.
Here's a demo: https://youtu.be/_HxUlad6Kd0

## What are Developers saying?
- Saved >40% effort in converting Figma to production ready code
- Flutter code generated has the best reliability over Cursor/Copilot/Dhiwise with state management, strong architecture and coding standards
- A 3 months project can be completed in <2 months
- Love Blueprints & the community around it  

## Benefits & Features you get with HuTouch @ $30/month:

Build unlimited production ready code for Frontend **in days not months**:
- Convert Figma to Prototypes ([Demo](https://youtu.be/_HxUlad6Kd0)):
  - Benefit: Highly reliable code for the entire UI in just a few mins 
  - Feature: Once your Figma, IDE is connected to HuTouch, just follow the instructions, select the Blueprint you like or edit to your specifications, provide functional requirements, and once HuTouch generates code, click REVIEW button to have the generated code added to your project in IDE.
- Modify code ([Demo](https://youtu.be/StyTP0loQ-k)):
  - Benefit: No impact to stability of existing code
  - Feature: Click Modify code, select your choice and provide a simple prompt. HuTouch will utilize your project details, coding standards of the project, reusable code and then generate code to maintain context and reusability 
- API Integration ([Demo](https://youtu.be/7Yl2go3JCZA)):
  - Benefit: Automatically extracts API specs and creates integration
  - Feature: Once your Postman is connected to HuTouch or you upload 3rd Party API specs, just follow the instructions to integrate your APIs
- Blueprints:
  - Benefit: Showcase your coding DNA to HuTouch community
  - Feature: Is part of coding tasks within HuTouch, use pre-built Blueprints that meet your project demands, or edit anyone to build your own, and HuTouch will use it to generate highly reliable code. You can also publish your Blueprint to help others in HuTouch community to use it for their projects.

# FLUTTER TASKS REINVENTED (Coming Soon...)
We won't stop there, we are reinventing how Flutter developers work for good. 
In addition to the repetitive/boring parts of coding, tasks outside coding keep developers away from doing meaningful work. Ex:  
- Analysis: Dig up decisions on requirements from different tools to do analysis before coding
- Task/Communication management: Retireve status/task details from multiple tools before formulating a message/an email
- Unit Test case creation
- Code reviews

At Niiti, we believe that the human perspective is not being applied to the real problem. We believe the narrative should be flipped, we should solve the workload problem using AI not bring in new workflows because of AI. So with HuTouch (short for Human Touch) we are automating the boring and assisting in daily chaos.  

**COME BE PART OF THE CHANGE SO THAT YOU DO WHAT MATTERS MOST**
