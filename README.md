#  HuTouch 🚀 Unleash your true potential

While corporates/industries profit from AI, **we developers are left with Grammarly for coding and irrelevant code**. It still is hard to make time for things that matter most or apply our hard earned skills. HuTouch is a personal AI for developers to generate tailored code and unleash their potential at work.

## 🌟 How does HuTouch Help

- Focus on applying your talents on complex/custom/challenging coding tasks while HuTouch generates the 1st working app/screen tailored to your project specs (saves >25% effort & generates >50% reusable code)
- Self review your code with HuTouch to reduce 20% review comments and thus have more time to focus on strengthening the code or validating the architecture
- Elevate your coding skills on the job with the help of articles/short tutorials recommended by HuTouch personalized to your current coding skills

## 🎯 What are customers saying?

- "Generated code is so much reusable and it does it in just one prompt"

- "Easily saves time by generating code better than bringing boilerplate code together"
