## HuTouch: Create Value Not Prompts 

## Problem: 
- Nearly half of Figma to Flutter (#F2F) production ready tasks are repetitive in nature
- AI code is unreliable
- Vibe coding is an additional workflow to existing workload
- No connections to Figma, Postman, IDE and Functional requirements doc to extract project specs

## Solution: 
- Automate repetitive parts of coding like boilerplate & prototyping using AI without prompts/vibe coding
- Automatically generate strong Flutter AI code with state management, strong architecture and coding standards
- Integrate with Figma, Postman, IDE and Functional requirements doc to extract project specs

We at Niiti, built HuTouch to help Flutter developers convert Figma to Production ready code **without vibe coding**.
Here's a demo: https://youtu.be/_HxUlad6Kd0

## What are Developers saying?
- Saved >40% effort in converting Figma to production ready code
- Flutter code generated has the best reliability over Cursor/Copilot/Dhiwise with state management, strong architecture and coding standards
- A 3 months project can be completed in <2 months 

## Benefits & Features:

Build production ready code for Frontend **in days not months**:
- Convert Figma to Prototypes ([Demo](https://youtu.be/_HxUlad6Kd0)): Once your Figma, IDE is connected to HuTouch, just follow the instructions, select the Blueprint you like or edit to your specifications, provide functional requirements and look for highly reliable code for the entire UI in a few mins
- Modify code ([Demo](https://youtu.be/StyTP0loQ-k)): Edit a logic in your code to match expected behavior for your screens
- API Integration ([Demo](https://youtu.be/7Yl2go3JCZA)): Once your Postman is connected to HuTouch or you upload 3rd Party API specs, just follow the instructions to integrate your APIs 
- Bug Fixes using Modify Code option ([Demo](https://youtu.be/sVhtIbnsKlI))

# FLUTTER TASKS REINVENTED (Coming Soon...)
We won't stop there, we are reinventing how Flutter developers work for good.
In addition to the repetitive/boring parts of coding, tasks outside coding keep developers away from doing meaningful work. Ex:  
- Analysis: Dig up decisions on requirements from different tools to do analysis before coding
- Task/Communication management: Retireve status/task details from multiple tools before formulating a message/an email
- Unit Test case creation
- Code reviews

At Niiti, we believe that the human perspective is not being applied to the real problem. We believe the narrative should be flipped, we should solve the workload problem using AI not bring in new workflows because of AI. So with HuTouch (short for Human Touch) we are automating the boring and assisting in daily chaos.  

**Come shape HuTouch with us to change the way we work so that we do what matters most**
