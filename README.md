#  AI coding today is unreliable ðŸ˜¤

In spite of AI's help, we still see the below issues with AI code:
- Loses context easily 
- Doesn't work well with existing code
- Doesn't have great coding standards
- Works on small code base, so only 5-10% effort is saved
- Requires too much vibe coding to tailor it to actual project specs

## HuTouch ðŸŒŸ Automate manual or vibe coding and other boring tasks

At Niiti, we built HuTouch just to solve this and we do it without vibe coding. HuTouch can be used on your existing code or to start off a new project. 
And then to top it, we added assistant skills. 
This helps developers save > 25% effort daily. Here is how:
- Automates coversion of project specs like, designs from Figma, API from Postman, functionality from requirements doc to a functional app
- Provides large code base and also works with small code base
- Generates highly reliable code where your personalized coding standards are used
- Establishes context, reuses existing code to generate new code   
- Removes chaos by digging up scattered info on task management, self review, write emails, summarize conversations
- Integrates into your daily workflow using your tools like, IDE (VS Code/Android Studio), Figma, Motiff, Postman, Jira, Google apps, Slack, etc  

We solved it with personalization and automation of all the boring set of coding/non-coding tasks. Our vision is to help developers put a dent in their workload so that they can #DoWhatMatters most.  

HuTouch is in it's early stages and here's a demo of the same: https://youtu.be/SBJmkvqkFhY?si=-R0WomazNJeXXt6e
