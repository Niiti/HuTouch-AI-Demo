#  HuTouch üöÄ Unleash your true potential

While corporates/industries profit from AI, **we developers are left with Grammarly for coding and irrelevant code**. It still is hard to make time for things that matter most or apply our hard earned skills. HuTouch is a personal AI for developers to generate tailored code and unleash their potential at work.

## üåü How does HuTouch Help

- Focus on applying your talents on complex/custom/challenging coding tasks while HuTouch generates the 1st working app/screen tailored to your project specs (saves >25% effort & generates >50% reusable code)
- Self review your code with HuTouch to reduce 20% review comments and thus have more time to focus on strengthening the code or validating the architecture
- Elevate your coding skills on the job with the help of articles/short tutorials recommended by HuTouch personalized to your current coding skills

## üéØ What are customers saying?

- "Generated code is so much reusable and it does it in just one prompt"

- "Easily saves time by generating code better than bringing boilerplate code together"

We have over 2 decades of IT experience and understand how difficult it is for us to make time to do things that matter most and so we have dedicated our time to fix this gap with a personal AI - HuTouch (short for human touch).

## üìÇ Projects

Below are a few projects we built using HuTouch to demonstrate how HuTouch helped
