#  Figma to Production Ready Flutter Code 

# Problem:
- AI coding tools require guidance to generate Flutter code
- No connections to Figma, Postman, IDE and Functional requirements doc to extract project specs

# Solution: 
- Automate boilerplate & prototyping using AI
- Automatically generate strong Flutter AI code with state management, strong architecture and coding standards
- Integrate with Figma, Postman, IDE and Functional requirements doc to extract project specs

We at Niiti, built HuTouch to help Flutter developers convert Figma to Production ready code without vibe coding.
Here's a demo: https://youtu.be/_HxUlad6Kd0

## FLUTTER TASKS REINVENTED
We didn't stop there, we reinvented how Flutter developers work for good, so that developers can do what matters most: Code & Create Value everyday.

## Problem:
About 61% of a Flutter tasks keep developers away from doing meaningful work. Developers are looking for help with their repetitive/boring parts of coding like prototyping/boilerplate coding and to manage their daily chaos. Instead we get unreliable solutions in AI that only speed the process by 5-10%.  

AI Code for boilerplate/prototyping:
- Is unreliable: Does not have Flutter architecture, state management, coding standards
- Needs prompts/vibe coding: Pushes developers to adopt a new workflow (prompts/vibe coding) which is not related to coding skills

Daily Chaos:
- Analysis: Dig up decisions on requirements from different tools to do analysis before coding
- Task/Communication management: Retireve status/task details from multiple tools before formulating a message/an email
  
## Solution: No vibe  coding, no chaos, only code that creates value

At Niiti, we believe that the human perspective is not being applied to the real problem. We believe the narrative should be flipped, we should solve the workload problem using AI not bring in new workflows because of AI. So with HuTouch (short for Human Touch) we automated the boring and created assistance for daily chaos.  

## ðŸŽ¯ What are Developers saying?
- Saved >40% effort in converting Figma to production ready code
- Flutter code generated has the best reliability over Cursor/Copilot/Dhiwise with state management, strong architecture and coding standards
- A 3 months project can be completed in <2 months 

## Benefits & Features:

Build production ready code for Frontend **in days not months**:
- Convert Figma to Prototypes ([Demo](https://youtu.be/_HxUlad6Kd0)): Once your Figma, IDE is connected to HuTouch, just follow the instructions, select your state management, predetermined strong coding standards, provide functional requirements and look for highly reliable code in a few mins
- Modify code ([Demo](https://youtu.be/StyTP0loQ-k)): Redo/edit a logic in your code to match expected behavior for your screens
- API Integration ([Demo](https://youtu.be/7Yl2go3JCZA)): Once your Postman is connected to HuTouch, just follow the instructions to allow HuTouch to generate code for API integration
- Enhancements/CRs using Modify Code option ([Demo](https://youtu.be/4OtfoU7agJo)): Add/enhance features on UI using Modify Code -> Update code option where context of your existing code will always be used
- Bug Fixes using Modify Code option ([Demo](https://youtu.be/sVhtIbnsKlI))
- Unit Test Case creation ([Demo](https://youtu.be/ytRw8CUNZsA)): Ask HuTouch to generate unit test cases for a specific file in your code
- Code Review ([Demo](https://youtu.be/ZweNqzPa66E)): Ask HuTouch to review your entire project 

**Declutter** to help you with tasks outside coding:
- Tasks: Once your tools like Slack, Jira are connected with HuTouch, ask HuTouch to dig up tasks that are important for the day
- Status email ([Demo](https://youtu.be/37Pa_f8L2CE)): Once your tools like Slack, Jira, Gmail/Outlook are connected with HuTouch, ask HuTouch to formulate your status email using data from your tools
- Continious Learning ([Demo](https://youtu.be/uhW3k444gB0)): Allow HuTouch to recommend personalized & short articles/tutorials that help elevate your skills weekly

**We are at the cusp of a new age, come shape HuTouch with us to change the way we work so that we do what matters most**
